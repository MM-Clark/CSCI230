Variety of applications to reinforce understanding of how to apply various data structures in programming.

Exam 1 Sorting Interface: Implements bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, binary search (iterative/recursive), add/remove for arrays.

JumpGame With Stack: Based off of a linear version of Jenga, where one player tries to stack as many blocks as possible without the tower falling. Player 1 chooses a number, and Player 2 keep adding to their stack until they think they have reached the correct number. If Player 2 guesses within two of Player 1's number without going over the number, Player 2 wins. Else, if Player 2 guesses too high or more than 2 below Player 1's number, Player 1 wins.
